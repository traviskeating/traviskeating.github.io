          Well this is a bit awkward... but I don't have anything
          that I can actually show you because when I got my new computer
          I sorta kinda lost my previous projects and none of them had been
          uploaded to the web because I didn't really get around to it... I
          mean I have some raw java code I can dump here but I doubt anyone
          would be too enthused about looking at several thousand lines of raw
          java code for a sub par text based space adventure game. Though I
          I suppose I could show off a pretty sexy combat class I made for it
          that I'm a bit proud of... Yeah, I'll just show you the raw code. 
          Just go ahead an hover your mouse over the image to zoom in and read
          a loop more exciting than wet paint!
