      <p><i>Or how I spend my free time</i></p>
      <p>
        On the off chance that you did not notice or chose not to notice my small
        introduction to my leisurely activities on the front page <i>(or perhaps you
        simply wish to read them again)</i> I shall now tell you of how I spend my free
        time.
      </p>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          A large portion of my time is spent gaming. I enjoy not only those games published
          in a digital medium, but also those published inthe analog medium, with my passion
          being more for the latter than for the former (though such a comparison is like asking
          someone if they prefer an amazing steak over a slightly more amazing steak).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now when I speak of analog games, I of course am referring to board games, crad games,
          war minature games, and of course table top RPGs (TRPGs if you will). I find the face
          to face nature of this medium to be what gives these games their charm (the additional
          benefit of not having to listen to prepubescent boys yelling at me over their microphones
          and the lack of glitches make the games all the more enjoyable). Of the afore mentioned
          game genres I have a great fondness of TRPGs, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. I have played
          TRPGs since I was but a wee lad of only 10 years. However I don't just play D&D (and other
          TRPG systems such as FATE, 13th Age, Corvus Bellie Infinity, Apocalypse World, etc.) I have
          also moderated (that is to say I created and maintained) numerous campaigns, and as a result
          I have created numerous worlds for my players to explore. If you should wish to learn more 
          about my most recent campaign world I would direct you to <a href="https://machinations-of-a-mad-god.obsidianportal.com/">
          my campaign wiki page</a>
        </p>
      <h3>Painting</h3>
        <p>
          I suppose I can't really count painting as a separate hobby from gaming seing as how I paint
          small plastic figurines called '<i>miniature</i>' that are used in TRPGs to represent characters
          on the battlefield. The art of miniatures painting recquires a meticulous eye for detail and a steady
          hand in order to be succesful but I consider the pay off to be more than enough to compensate
          the countless hours and money I've spent on paint, miniatures, brushes, and other implements of
          painting. If you're inclined to learn more about miniatures painting I recommend looking at 
          <a href="https://reapermini.com">Reaper Miniatures</a>, where I purchase the majority of my minis
          and some of my paints (however my preferred paint is <a href="http://www.acrylicosvallejo.com/en_US">
