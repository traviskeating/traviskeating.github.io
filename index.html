                <p>Why hello there! My name is Travis "T3" Keating. If you're curious
                about how and/or why I put <i>'T3'</i> in between my first and last names,
                While this is a valid question I feel little need in explaining it beyond
                the fact that it has to do with basketball and tractor trailers. Where are
                my manners? You've clicked all this way to come here and all I've done  is
                blather on about nothing. <i>*AHEM*</i> Now where was I? Oh yes, I am a
                <b>Software Development</b> major at <b>Georgia Gwinnett College</b> and
                I am currently in my 9th semester, that is to say, the start of my fifth year.
                <i>"But Travis, why would you stay in college for 5 years when you are seeking
                a major that only takes 4 years to complete?"</i> Well my dear reader that is
                a very astute observation followed by a question that my extended family often
                asks me at our occasional family functions. You see dear reader, I was not always
                a disciple of data, a connoisseur of code, a practitioner  of Python, a sophisticate
                of software. There was a darker time in my life when I was a <b>biology</b> major, and
                there was an even darker time before that when I was a <b>psychology</b> major. It was
                not until I discovered the <b>Unity Game Engine</b> that I found my true calling as
                a video game developer. As it stands now I am but a somewhat humble journeyman in that
                great proffesion that is called <b>Software Development.</b></p>
            
            <h2 align="center">Interests and the Like</h2>
            
            <p>
                Some of you may be curious as to what leisure activities I participate in. While
                I'm inclined to accuse you of being overly nosey and bordering on rude I shall oblige
                you, after all you have read this far and that has some merit I suppose. The subject
                which reigns as my primary passion is, at the risk of becoming controversial, my faith.
                While I conceed that not every individual adheres to my beleifs I nontheless pursue them
                to the best of my ability. My second obsession is that of games, and not of the athletic
                variety. Rather I partake in both digital and analog games. Below I've placed several images
                of some of my favorite games (both analog and digital)
